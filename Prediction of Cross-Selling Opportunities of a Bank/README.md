# Prediction of Cross-Selling Opportunities of a Bank

This project was required for successful completion of the course in Data Mining in Marketing at Goethe University. 

Goal of the project: To build an accurate predictive model in order to correctly classify customers and therefore increase effectiveness of direct marketing of a commercial bank.

Solution: The XGBoost method was implemented on a bank data set with information on bank account openings as a dependent variable and various customer features.

Result: The hyperparameter-tuned model could outperform the accuracy of the Random Forest used as a benchmark for comparison. Through feature importance analysis it was found that specific customer characteristics have a strong influence on the prediction (customer activity, age, product ads).
