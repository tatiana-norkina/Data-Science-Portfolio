# Prediction of Spotify Songâ€™s Popularity and EDA 

This project was conducted during participation at TechAcademy of Goethe University. TechAcademy is a student initiative that aims to raise up students as next digital leaders. 

Goal of the project: To draw meaningful patterns and insights from a data set with various song attributes, and build the most accurate prediction model of song popularity.

Solution: 170k Spotify songs were merged with key song attributes such as their valence, acousticness, energy etc. The correlation between variables was examined and machine learning algorithms were used to overperform a benchmark simple regression model.

Result: Exploratory Data Analysis has revealed that over time songs have become shorter due to financial incentives of the streaming market. Today danceability and energy of songs are key song features which determine the success on Spotify. For the prediction task completion, the lowest RMSE was achieved by implementation of Random Forest algorithm among other algorithms.
