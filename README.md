[Prediction of Check-In Behavior for the Restaurant Category](https://github.com/tatiana-norkina/data-science-portfolio/blob/69fa6224ab9ea08d158c15f14b44c45f1efd2516/Prediction%20of%20Check-In%20Behavior/DailyLevelData_analysis_short.r) 

Goal: Restaurants need to know what internal and external factors drive customer behavior. For that, it is needed to accurately predict whether a consumer will visit a restaurant and to determine the most important variables influencing his behavior.

Solution: 29k reviews with check-in information and various attributes were collected from the Yelp website and combined with information on daily weather conditions. Handling outliers and missing values, treating imbalance data and data normalization were considered in order to use ML algorithms and increase model performance.

Result: The Boosting algorithm with the highest TDL and GINI coefficient among other ML algorithms found that the volume of online reviews of a restaurant significantly affects the number of restaurant visits. Also, the online popularity of a reviewer influences visiting behavior. With this information restaurant owners can consider the refinements of their digital strategies I order to increase restaurant visits.
